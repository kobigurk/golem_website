            <h1>How and why Golem will change<br>the world (or at least the Internet)</h1>

            <ul class="faq-list">
              <li>
                What is Golem?
                <span>
                    Golem can be used by anyone to sell the computer’s computing time over the internet to other users (we call these users <strong>providers</strong>, as they provide computing time of their computers to the network). Consequently, anyone can use Golem to buy other’s computers time and use it to complete own computationally demanding tasks (we call these users <strong>requestors</strong>, as they request computing time from the network). So basicly Golem is a software that enables people to trade theirs computers time, effectively creating market (or more precisely: prosumers market) of computing power.
                    <br><br>
                    What Golem gives to the requestors can be considered as so called infrastructure as a service  (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). Of course to have any use of infrastructure and platform, you need software. And if it happens that you are not willing or able to write that software on your own, than you can use Golem’s <strong>software store</strong> to get it - for free or in a software as a service model (SaaS), depending on the licence and decision of the software creator.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                Who and why uses Golem?
                <span>
                    The short answer is that Golem can be used (and should be used) by everyone who owns a computer.  
                    <br><br>
                    The long answer is that how you use Golem depends on what you use your computer for.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are an average user, you are probably a provider only. Golem gives yours computer work to do when it is not used and you earn money this way. The money comes from requestors, paying providers for using their machines.
                    <br><br>
                    If for any purpose you need more computing time than you have on your machine - because you are CGI professional, scientist, financial market tycoon, cryptocurrency miner or anyone else fitting in the wide range of Golem’s use cases - then you use Golem as the requestor. You submit your task to the network, you get it done and you pay the providers for theirs machines time. Additionally, if the task you want to perform needs proprietary software - you can get it through the store.
                    <br><br>
                    And if you are owner of open source or proprietary software (like rendering engine, analytical packages, trading robots, specialised scientific packages, Dapp), you may want to use Golem as a distribution channel and (if you opt to charge for use) as a marketplace.                
               </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the state of the project and the way ahead?
                <span>
                    The alpha version was launched in August 2016, with the code available for review in the next few days. The alpha version (codename Brass Golem) will be focused on CGI rendering in Blender (blender.org) and is mainly proof of concept, although we expect it will be useful for blender users and once we move to release version will have a group of dedicated users.
                    <br><br>
                    We provide the following plan:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Brass Golem <br>
                          <cite>...these are created to fulfill one goal, set at the time of their creation, and wait with absolute patience until activated to perform this task.</cite>
                          <br><br>
                          Brass Golem is where we are at the moment (in alpha test now). The current version of Golem is only focused on rendering in Blender and although it will be useful to CGI artists, we consider CGI rendering to be primarily a proof of concept and training ground. After a full cycle of tests, Brass Golem will be released in Autumn this year. Even though we do not expect that blender CGI rendering will create enough turnover to justify all the work we have put in the project, this will be the first decentralised computing power market and at the same time (most likely) the first thing you will be able to pay for with your Ethers. 
                      </li>
                      <li>Clay Golem<br>
                          <cite>There is a chance (...) that a Clay Golem will be possessed by a chaotic evil spirit. If this happens control is lost and the Golem attacks the closest living creature.</cite>
                          <br><br>
                          Clay Golem is meant to be a big leap from where we are now. It may come at the cost of compromised stability and security. So although some features of the Clay Golem (especially improved nat-punching and new use cases) will probably make it to the release phase, Clay Golem, as defined at milestone 1, will remain a laboratory creature, serving as a bridge between the Brass and Stone phase.
                      </li>
                      <li>Stone Golem<br>
                          <cite>Stone Golems do not revoke their creators control like (...) Clay Golems.</cite>
                          <br><br>
                          Stone Golem will be the first version close to what we want Golem to be. Apart from an increased security and stability, the most important improvement will be the introduction of a basic task API and a task deployment framework: we do not want to develop the use case by use case by ourselves. Our objective is to give developers means to integrate with Golem. This will also be supplemented with the transaction system features enabling software use payments - along with hardware use payments. 
                      </li>
                      <li>Iron Golem<br>
                          <cite>Iron Golems are made of iron and are among the strongest type of Golem. They never revoke the control of the wizard that created them.</cite>
                          <br><br>
                          Iron Golem is what we want to deliver with the support of GNT financing. Compared to Stone Golem, it will have much more features and an advanced task API and a task definition framework (with task definition UI/GUI). We also plan integrations with other projects within the Ethereum scope, like on-chain reputation systems or extensions of the transaction system to enhance its capacity and functionality (at the moment, Raiden seems to be a good fit for that).

              <li>
                How Golem will help to build a new Internet of tomorrow?
                <span>
                    The Golem Network has a potential to become 'a computing element' of a truly decentralised web. Once it is possible to bulk-rent machines not only to compute specific task, but also to perform specific operations within a self-organising network, then the decentralised Internet will eventually emerge. Of course the Golem Network is only one of the puzzles. The decentralised web will need many other technologies - and they are emerging now - take all the work already done and continued within Ethereum (eg. DEVp2p, Whisper or SWARM) or IPFS. You can easily imagine the Golem Network, integrated with IPFS, using DEVp2p successor to power Babl microservices to host a solution like Inkpad. Such an advancement of Internet technology is possible and may happen very soon but only if we work on all pieces of the puzzles. And that is the ultimate reason why the Golem Project has a huge long-term potential.

                How Golem works?
                <span>
                    Golem is a p2p network, ie. there is no central server and users are equally privileged. People who want to compute some tasks in the network and people who have computer power to rent broadcast their offers in the network. Golem auction algorithm match providers and requestors taking into account prices, reputation and machine performance. Resources, ie. files needed for computation are sent to providers machine. After computation provider's app sent back results to the requestor app. If result pass verification process, provider is paid. If someone tries to cheat, ie. send bad results or doesn't pay, he/she will lose reputation and won't be chosen again for computation.

              </li>
              <li>
                How are your going to verify computations?
                <span>
                    There will be different methods depending on the task type. Users which add a new task can implement a new verification method that suits for this new problem. Possible solution may involve:
                    <ul>
                        <li>simple checking correctness of the result, eg. proof-of-work,</li>
                        <li>redundant computation, ie. few providers compute same part of the task and their results are compared,</li>
                        <li>computing small, random part of the task and comparing this part with result send by provider, ie. comparing color of few random pixels in rendered picture,</li>
                        <li>analysis of output logs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                Why are you making it decentralized?
                <span>
                  We believe that decentralization will be the direction in which future of internet development will be going. With the decentralization of the system it will be possible to achieve full scalability without expanding and maintaining of own network and server infrastructure; the solution will also be free from single points of failure and resistant to attempts to disable and censorship.

              <li>
                How will the payments look like? Will user use their credit cards?
                <span>
                    Prices for computation unit in Golem system should be significantly lower than in alternative solutions, so payment system in Golem must support a large number of micropayments (or even nanopayments). Therefore, we uses Ethereum system as a payment platform. You can see payments contract in our <a href="https://github.com/imapp-pl/ethereum-contracts">repository</a>. Additionally, using decentralized payment system allows Golem to be fully decentralized and independent from external payments providers.

                Aren't you afraid to use Ethereum? It's still an experiment rather than real currency.
                <span>
                  Ethereum has been working for a last few months currently in it's stable Homestead version and has been used by many investors. It's not only a breakthrough for the blockchain technology. It also creates a great environment and vibrant community for us, who are very much inside the new P2P Internet.

              <li>
                How users will get Ethers?
                <span>
                  People can buy ethers using online exchange services, using traditional currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, PLN, etc) or virtual currencies (BTC, Dash, Doge, etc). Additionally users that shares their machines as providers will earn ethers that allows them to finance their potential future requests.

              <li>
                Are you using some external solutions / libraries?
                <span>
                    We're using Ethereum (<a href="https://ethereum.org/">https://ethereum.org/</a>) as a payment system, IPFS (<a href="https://ipfs.io/">https://ipfs.io/</a>) for resource distribution and Docker (<a href="https://www.docker.com/">https://www.docker.com/</a>) containers as computational environments.

              <li>
                Have you thought about using Lightning Network?
                <span>
                    Yes, we have. But the solution in its current form is still too expensive to fulfil Golem’s requirements for one-to-many payment scenario. The cost of opening a channel is much bigger than a cost of a single transaction and in Golem Network and routing algorithms for finding shorter paths are still under development. We don't reject the possibility of changing payment system to  Raiden (Ethereum based Lightning Network) someday when it'll be fully mature system. You can learn more about current subaccount solution and potential future lottery solution in Golem nanopayments whitepaper (<a href="http://golemproject.net/doc/GolemNanopayments.pdf">http://golemproject.net/doc/GolemNanopayments.pdf</a>).

            <h1>Golem business model</h1>

            <ul class="faq-list">
              <li>
                What is the business case behind Golem?
                <span>
                  Golem is open source software is and will remain free to use. Requestors have to pay providers for the time of their machines. This payment goes from requestor to provider and Golem takes a fee for that to secure further development of the software. Default fee is 5 percent, it is voluntary and it is paid by requestor. In the future the fee level might be changed and/or made it mandatory.

              <li>
                What are use cases for Golem?
                <span>
                    The first and very illustrative use case of Golem is CGI rendering. Other technically similar to implement use cases are scientific, engineering, statistical and financial tasks which need extensive computing and are (technically) feasible to distribute. Another possible early application of Golem are cryptocurrency mining pools. We are not going to explore and develop all possible use cases, but we will rather focus on delivering task API and task definition framework to give developers ability to integrate any software with the Golem Network.
                    <br>
                    Many use cases will need proprietary software, either existing or design specially for Golem. To facilitate the use of both open and proprietary software, we will introduce Golem Shop to enable any requestor to use Golem-ready software. If the software is proprietary, then requestor will be able to use it in a software-as-a-service model. This way Golem will act not only as a market for computing power, but also as a distribution channel for software creators.

              <li>
                Why price of computing will be lower in Golem Network?
                <span>
		    The prices are expected to be low because the market will be very close to textbook perfect competition concept:
                   <ul>
                        <li>the product (compute) is homogenous,</li>
                        <li>the information for both requester and provider is complete,</li>
                        <li>all requestors and providers have very small market share and have negligible impact on overall prices,</li>
                        <li>barriers to entry and exit are very low.</li>
                   </ul>
                   And on the market with perfect competition the prices are as low as they can be to have producers (providers) still on the market - which means that Golem Network will create situation very different to the today’s internet infrastructure - with a few large providers and a market close to the monopolistic competition.

              <li>
                Why Golem is unlikely to be successfully copied?
                <span>
                    Golem software is open-source and as such it can be forked by other parties. We are sure that over time many Golem forks will emerge either for specialised or general purposes. We believe that in its core business Golem will not be endangered by this process because:                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Golem business model strongly favors larger network over the smaller network, so the first and largest network will always be preferable solution over the smaller networks.</li>
                        <li>What Golem Network delivers is an infrastructure, open for any project, software, dapp, community etc. willing to use it. So any individual or organisation interested in building own decentralised solution (or own decentralised market place) will be able to use Golem as a platform, without a need of copying it. Therefore developers of software will not be interested in copying Golem as long as we will be able to provide all features they need.</li>
                        <li>Requestors choose where to buy compute based on price and functionality. Our real competitors are Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and other cloud providers. Our aim is to provide similar functionality at much lower prices.</li>
                        <li>The transaction fee is (at the moment) voluntary and prices will be set in a market-driven way, so both for providers and requestor there is no price-driven incentive to set up own network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
              </li>

            <h1>Other issues</h1>

            <ul class="faq-list">
              <li>
                Can you use private data for computation? Can computing users see your data?
                <span>
                    Unfortunately, right now Golem cannot support private data. Computing application usually needs direct access to the data and they have to be decrypted at some point.
                    Therefore, curious providers may see what exactly is computed on their machines and see their part of the data.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                What if someone would like to use Golem for DDoS, Botnet or other illegal activities?
                <span>
                    Computations will take place in isolated environment that doesn’t have access to the network, so Golem can’t be used for DDoS or Botnet this way.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                Is it safe?
                <span>
                    Every new technology is exposed to attacks, especially, new and unpredicted ones. All components of Golem application have been designed to be robust to the attacks. 
                    Key security elements are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>isolated environments in which computation take place working with least privilege,</li>
                        <li>well-known safety cryptography base on elliptic curves,</li>
                        <li>reputation system which allows to detect bad behaving users,</li>
                        <li>possilibilty to blacklist some users.</li>
